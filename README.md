# Healthcare Data Sharing and Consent Management System

A decentralized application (DApp) built on the Stacks blockchain for secure and transparent management of healthcare data sharing and patient consent.

## Overview

This system enables patients to maintain sovereignty over their medical data while providing healthcare providers with secure, authorized access. Built using Clarity smart contracts, the system implements a comprehensive consent management framework with built-in incentive mechanisms.

## Key Features

- **Patient Data Control**: Patients maintain full control over their medical data access
- **Granular Consent Management**: Flexible consent levels (full, partial, emergency)
- **Secure Data Storage**: Encrypted data storage with key management
- **Provider Verification**: Healthcare provider registration and verification system
- **Access Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail of all data access
- **Token Incentives**: Reward system for data sharing participation
- **Emergency Access**: Special provisions for emergency medical situations

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Patient Management**
    - Patient registration
    - Encryption key storage
    - Data hash management

2. **Provider Registry**
    - Provider verification
    - Rating system
    - Access credentials

3. **Consent System**
    - Time-bound authorizations
    - Multiple access levels
    - Revocation capabilities

4. **Access Control**
    - Request validation
    - Authorization checks
    - Emergency override protocols

5. **Audit System**
    - Access logging
    - Timestamp tracking
    - Activity monitoring

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Stacks blockchain environment
- Clarity CLI tools
- Stacks wallet for deployment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/healthcare-dapp
cd healthcare-dapp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Deploy contracts:
```bash
clarinet deploy
```

### Contract Deployment

1. Deploy provider registry:
```bash
clarinet contract-call --contract-name healthcare --function deploy-registry
```

2. Deploy patient management:
```bash
clarinet contract-call --contract-name healthcare --function deploy-patient-system
```

## Usage

### Patient Registration

```clarity
(contract-call? .healthcare register-patient encryption-key)
```

### Provider Registration

```clarity
(contract-call? .healthcare register-provider provider-name)
```

### Granting Consent

```clarity
(contract-call? .healthcare grant-consent provider-principal "full" duration)
```

### Requesting Data Access

```clarity
(contract-call? .healthcare request-data-access patient-principal data-type)
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Privacy**
    - All patient data is stored in encrypted form
    - Encryption keys are managed securely
    - Access requires valid consent records

2. **Access Control**
    - Time-bound access permissions
    - Multi-level authorization checks
    - Automated access logging

3. **Smart Contract Security**
    - Input validation
    - Access control checks
    - Error handling
    - State management

## Token Economics

### Reward System

- Base reward for data sharing
- Bonus for complete medical records
- Special incentives for research participation

### Token Distribution

- Patient rewards pool
- Provider incentives
- System maintenance fund

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
clarinet test
```

Key test scenarios:
- Patient registration
- Consent management
- Access control
- Emergency procedures
- Token distribution

## Future Enhancements

1. **Technical Improvements**
    - Enhanced privacy features
    - Advanced encryption schemes
    - Cross-chain interoperability

2. **Feature Additions**
    - AI-powered access patterns
    - Automated compliance checking
    - Advanced analytics dashboard

3. **Integration Opportunities**
    - Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems
    - Health information exchanges
    - Research institutions
